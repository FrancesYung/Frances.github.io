Hi! Thank you for checking me out. I am a postdoc at [Vera Demberg's group](https://www.uni-saarland.de/lehrstuhl/demberg.html) at the [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html).

My primary research focus lies in exploring **discourse relations** at the intersection of NLP, corpus linguistics, and experimental psycholinguistics. 

I am currently pursuing my [habilitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habilitation).
