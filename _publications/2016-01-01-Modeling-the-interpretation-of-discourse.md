excerpt: 'We propose a framework to model human comprehension of discourse connectives. Following the Bayesian pragmatic paradigm, we advocate that discourse connectives are interpreted based on a simulation of the production process by the speaker, who, in turn, considers the ease of interpretation for the listener when choosing connectives. Evaluation against the sense annotation of the Penn Discourse Treebank confirms the superiority of the model over literal comprehension. A further experiment demonstrates that the proposed model also improves automatic discourse parsing.'

We propose a framework to model human comprehension of discourse connectives. Following the Bayesian pragmatic paradigm, we advocate that discourse connectives are interpreted based on a simulation of the production process by the speaker, who, in turn, considers the ease of interpretation for the listener when choosing connectives. Evaluation against the sense annotation of the Penn Discourse Treebank confirms the superiority of the model over literal comprehension. A further experiment demonstrates that the proposed model also improves automatic discourse parsing.
