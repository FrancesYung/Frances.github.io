excerpt: 'This paper reports our ongoing project for constructing an English multiword expression (MWE) dictionary and NLP tools based on the developed dictionary. We extracted functional MWEs from the English part of Wiktionary, annotated the Penn Treebank (PTB) with MWE information, and conducted POS tagging experiments. We report how the MWEannotation is done on PTB and the results of POS and MWE tagging experiments.'

This paper reports our ongoing project for constructing an English multiword expression (MWE) dictionary and NLP tools based on the developed dictionary. We extracted functional MWEs from the English part of Wiktionary, annotated the Penn Treebank (PTB) with MWE information, and conducted POS tagging experiments. We report how the MWEannotation is done on PTB and the results of POS and MWE tagging experiments.
